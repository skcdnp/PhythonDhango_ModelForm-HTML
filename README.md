Utilizing Model Form and HTML for customized forms

Sometime library such as widget_tweaks is just not enough.
I have had situation where i want to customize my html with bootstrap but just didnt know how to connect forms.py to html.
Sample here gives high level direction. You will have to modify the code to meet your need but it should get you started.
